inferential statistics:

descriptive data:
 will give you summary of data ,on which you can do analysis with the help of python libraries and try to understand data
 
 analysis: 1.you find suitable column for our projcts
           2.data cleaning and (remove irrelevant data)
		   3.data transform (datatype change, column name change)
		   
	at the end you got summary data after following above steps you got data which is ready for to apply ML algorithm
		   
 
 libraries:-pandas,numpy,matplotlib,seaborn,scipy
 
 algorithm is a code or some principle which workson specific data and case studies. 
 
 inferential statistics:(conclusion,result):
 you applied on proccessed data machine learning,deep learning,nlp algorithm,timeseries algorithm 
 
 what is algorithm?
 it is series of steps to solve any problem
 
 a= number
 b=number2
 c=a+b
 print('addition of number:',c)
 
 algorithm:
 1.accept 2 number
 2.apply sum logic on 2 value
 3.print the result
 
 ml algorithm: 1.linear regression 2.logical regression 3.support vector machine 4.k nearest neighbor 5.k mean 6.neural network 7.random forest,dsion tree
 
 Deep learning:
 CNN              Timesreies          NLP
 LSTM              ARIMA              NAIVE BAYES
 RNN               LSTM                LSTM
 
 Sampling:
 
 population:Whole dataset
 
 sample:- small % of data from specific dataset
 10000 population
 100 sample
 
 sampling method: how you select data and analyse the data 
 seed=42
 data select randomly from set of data
 
 sampling type:
 a) probability sampling
 b) non-probabilty sampling
 
 A)probability sampling:1. simple random sampling 2.clutered sampling 3.systeamatic sampling,strafied sampling
 
 B)non-probability sampling: 1. convenience sampling 2.consecutiv sampling 3.quota sampling 4.snowball sampling 5.purposive sampling

Confidence interval:means variation in your expected estimetd result-variation in result when you redo
CI :-range of value for unkown parameter
bp=120/80
bp=119/78
